 * The payload is a big-endian bitstream, not a byte-aligned struct: every field is written at
 * whatever bit offset the previous one ended on. Wire order is depth-first over
 * `{ int8 triple[3]; CharHeader header; char name[64]; }`, where `triple` is race, gender and
 * class in that order. Each `triple` entry is a 1-bit presence flag followed by 8 value bits
 * biased by +0x80; the header's fields are 8, 16 or 32 bits biased by +0x80, +0x8000 or not at
 * all; and the 64-byte name begins at bit 261. This parser consumes the first 261 bits and
 * ignores the name, which every observed capture leaves as the placeholder "Player".
 *
 * The header is emitted in the record's own little-endian struct layout rather than as parsed
 * fields, since both encoders want it as an opaque block. Its last field is the one value that
 * is not copied through: the request carries 0 where the record requires 1.
 *
 * @param message Parsed Web Service envelope.
 * @param request Receives the parsed creation fields.
 * @return True when the payload holds all 261 bits, every presence flag is set, and race, gender
 *         and class are all in range.
